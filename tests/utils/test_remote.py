"""
RemoteResource tests and justification

We are not testing downloading behavior, because that is difficult and requires resources to achieve. 
We are assuming the code 'works', and validating the rest of the methods.

We test the branchpoints on check_exists because we cannot guarantee correctness without types


No tests for ABCs, as they are just stubs.
Implementors of the ABCs we have created are


Regression/functional tests exist in their own file.

Last set of tests, which should be marked to NOT run in automated tests, and only in a manual manner.
These download and test the behavior of each method, explicitly.
