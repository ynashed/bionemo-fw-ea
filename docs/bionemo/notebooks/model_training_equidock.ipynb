    "## Overview - EquiDock model\n",
    "\n",
    "[**EquiDock**](../models/equidock.md) is an pairwise-independent SE(3)-equivariant graph matching network used in protein-protein rigid docking. EquiDock predicts the rotation and translation to place one of the proteins at the right docked position relative to the second protein and it is trained over DIPS and DB5 datasets. EquiDock uses Kabsch algorithm and optimal transport loss to learns the binding pockets with docking poses from keypoint matching (optimal transport) and alignment (Kabsch). \n",
    "\n",
    "This EquiDock model training example walkthrough will show how to utilize the compute resources, download and preprocess the datasets, and perform model training on single and multiple nodes.  "
